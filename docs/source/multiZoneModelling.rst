Multi-zone building modeling
============================

In this chapter the application of the BuildingSystems library for multi-zone building modeling is demonstrated.

For this purpose a thermal building model of the *Thermal Model House* (http://www.thermisches-modellhaus.de) with
two thermal zones shall be created:

.. figure:: /images/ThermalModelHouse.*
   :scale: 50 %

   Thermal Model house: A portable experimental test facility for building physics studies, developed by UdK Berlin.

The *Thermal Model House* (THM) is a portable experimental test facility with a simple geometry and a compact size
of approximately 1 m length, 0.5 m depth and 0.5 m height. This small thermal box is able to reproduce
different phenomena of building climatization within physical experiments. Due to its manifold configuration
options, experiments about the energy balance of rooms, about the heat and air transport processes within
rooms, about ventilation, heating and cooling of buildings as well as about building control are enabled.
The THM is being developed at the Institute of Architecture and Urban Planning at UdK Berlin.
It is used for the education of architect and engineering students and also for research.

One configuration of the THM works with a inner partition wall, which divides the air volume of the
box into two different thermal zones. These zones can be separately heated or cooled by individual
heating surfaces on the bottom and cooling surfaces on the ceiling. Exactly this configuration
shall be modelled in the present case.

The modelling and simulation process is described using the Modelica simulation environment Dymola (version Dymola 2016).
First of all the Modelica library *BuildingSystems* has to be loaded into Dymola. After that, the library
will occur in the library tree in addition to the other present Modelica libraries.

The creation and configuration of a new thermal building model takes place in the following steps:

* Configuration of the building model structure (topology of the construction of the buildings model)
* Definition of the building model parameters (building geometry and physical parameters of the construction elements)
* Definition of the boundary conditions of the system model (climate conditions of the building ambient, set temperatures for heating and cooling for each thermal zone)

Set up the building model structure
-----------------------------------

1. **Create a new package** for your simulation experiment

  * Open dialog: *File* -> *New* -> *Package* and fill in the field *Name of new package:* "ThermalModelHouse" and click OK

  * Mark the new package *ThermalModelHouse* in the package browser and save it with *File* -> *Save* in the file *ThermalModelHouse.mo* in a folder of your choice.

2. **Create a new building model**, based on the template model class *BuildingTemplate*. Therefore insert a new building model in the previous defined package as follows:

  .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM01.*
     :scale: 50 %

     Definition of a building model based on a building template

  * Open dialog: *File* -> *New* -> *Model* and fill in the field *Name of new model:* "Building". Then
    click on the button right of the field *Extends (optional):* and navigate to the model class
    *BuildingSystems.Buildings.BaseClasses.BuildingTemplate* and click OK. Further click on the button right of the field
    *Insert in Package (optional):* and navigate to the package *ThermalModelHouse* on the top level and click OK (compare the Dymola screenshoot above).

  .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM02.*
     :scale: 50 %

     View on the empty building model

  As a result you can see now the inner structure (the *Diagram view* in Dymola) of the empty building model.
  On the left side you see the interfaces to the building ambient, below the interfaces to the ground of the building and on
  the right side the input signals for the set temperatures for heating and cooling of each zone and the interfaces of the air
  paths to the ambient.


3. **Instantiate two thermal zones**, which shall represent the left and right part of the TMH.

  For this purpose drag and drop a component model from the class *BuildingSystems.Buildings.Zones.ZoneTemplateAirvolumeMixed*
  into the building model and rename it to *zone1*. Add *zone2* in the same manner:

  .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM03.*
     :scale: 50 %

     Building model with two thermal zones

4. **Instantiate construction elements**.

  For the opaque constructions (walls, bottoms, ceilings etc.) use the model class
  *BuildingSystems.Buildings.Constructions.Walls.WallThermal1DNodes* and for the transparent constructions (windows) the model class
  *BuildingSystems.Buildings.Constructions.Windows.Window*.

  Notice, that each component comes with a blue line (which indicates side 1)
  and has the connector *toSurfacePort_1*. The other unmarked side 2 owns the connector *toSurfacePort_2*.
  The blue line helps you to distinguish both component sides, e.g. if you want to define single layers of a construction
  in a certain order. In our case we bring all component models in a position, that all blue lines
  show to the zones respectively in the case of the partition wall to *zone1* and to the adjacent *zone2*.

  .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM04.*
     :scale: 50 %

     Building model with zone and construction models

  In our case we have to instantiate seven walls (*wall1* to *wall7*), two bottoms (*bottom1* and *bottom2*), two ceilings (*ceiling1* and *ceiling2*)
  and two windows models (*window1* and *window2*).

5. **Connect construction elements**.

  Now connect the connectors of all "blue sides" with the zone models as in the following picture:

  .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM05.*
     :scale: 60 %

     Building model with connected construction elements

  Here each zone model offers you six different positions for connections to the construction elements (*toConstructionPorts1* to *toConstructionPorts6*)
  to  enable a simplification of the graphical diagram.

  In a further step connect the connectors of the other sides of all construction elements to the construction connector of the building model (*toConstructionPorts* on the left side).

  Finally connect the input values of *T_setHeating* and *T_setCooling* (four connections) and the output values
  *Q_flow_heating* and *Q_flow_cooling* (again four connections) from the building model to both zone models.
  Now your topology of your building model is completely specified:

  .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM06.*
     :scale: 100 %

     Completed topology of the building model with two thermal zones


Define the building model parameters
------------------------------------

Now the building model has to be completed with parameters, which exactly describe the problem. The first type are geometrical parameters,
e.g. the size of the construction elements or the volumes of the zones. The second type are physical parameters which define the building constructions
(e.g. the heat conductivity or specific heat capacity of the used materials).

1. Geometrical parameters

   The THM has a strongly simplified geometry. In our problem each thermal zone describes one half of the THM, which has in total an inner dimension
   of 1.0 m x 0.5 m x 0.5 m. So each opaque construction element (walls, bottoms and ceilings) has a height of 0.5 m and a width of 0.5 m.
   Double-click on each component and fill in these values in the *General tab* in the *Geometry* group.

   Both thermal zones have an air volume of 0.5 m x 0.5 m x 0.5 m = 0.125 m3. The height of the zone is 0.5 m.
   Fill in these values into the zone model's *zone1* and *zone2*.

   Each of the windows of the THM has a width of 0.378 m and a height of 0.33 m, which leads to a window area of approx. 0.125 m2.
   The thickness of the window pane is 0.003 m. Assign these three values to both window models.

   Because *window1* is enclosed in *wall6* and *window2* in *wall5* the area of the window models has to be communicated from the window to the wall models.
   Double-click on *wall6* and fill in the parameter field *nInnSur* 1 and in the field *AInnSur* using the *Edit Text* option

   .. code-block:: modelica

      aInnSur={window1.A)

   Do the same with *wall5* and *window2*.

   Finally add the parameter values for the orientation of each construction elements, which face to the ambient by setting the azimuth angle
   and the tilt angle. The default values for each construction element (walls and windows are 90.0 degree for the tilt angle and 0.0 degree
   for the azimuth angle. North is defined by an azimuth angle of 180 degree, east by -90 degree and west by + 90 degree:

   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | element | angleAzi | angleTil | element | angleAzi | angleTil |
   +=========+==========+==========+=========+==========+==========+
   | wall1   |  90.0    | 90.0     | bottom1 | 0.0      | 180.0    |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | wall2   | 180.0    | 90.0     | bottom2 | 0.0      | 180.0    |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | wall3   | 180.0    | 90.0     | ceiling1| 0.0      |   0.0    |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | wall4   | -90.0    | 90.0     | ceiling2| 0.0      |   0.0    |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | wall5   |   0.0    | 90.0     | window1 | 0.0      |  90.0    |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | wall6   |   0.0    | 90.0     | window2 | 0.0      |  90.0    |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+
   | wall7   |  default | default  |         |          |          |
   +---------+----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+

2. Construction parameters

   All the opaque construction elements except the partition *element wall7* share the same construction.
   For this reason a common construction type shall be configured, which will be later assigned
   to each individual construction.

   * Definition of a construction type

     Extend a child record from the general parent record for opaque constructions
     *BuildingSystems.Buildings.Data.Constructions.OpaqueThermalConstruction* and rename it to *Construction1THM*. Then
     include it in the package *ThermalModelHouse*.

     .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM07a.*
        :scale: 65 %

        Definition of a construction type based on template for opaque constructions

     The *Construction1THM* shall have three layers. The materials of the three layers are 0.006 m wood, 0.030 m insulation
     and again 0.009 m wood. The layer order is counted from inside (zone) to outside (building ambient). The
     BuildingSystems library contains in the package *BuildingSystems.HAM.Data.MaterialProperties*
     a database with pre-defined thermal and hygro-thermal material property sets.

     Now double-click on the construction type record *Construction1THM* left in the package browser and adapt the parameterization
     of the construction direct in the Modelica source code editor of Dymola with the help of the pre-defined materials:

     .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM07.*
        :scale: 70 %

        Adapted record type of the first construction

     .. code-block:: modelica

        record Construction1THM
          "Outer constructions of the THM"
          extends BuildingSystems.Buildings.Data.Constructions.OpaqueThermalConstruction(
            nLayers=3,
            thickness={0.006,0.030,0.009},
            material={BuildingSystems.HAM.Data.MaterialProperties.Thermal.Wood(),
            BuildingSystems.HAM.Data.MaterialProperties.Thermal.Insulation(),
            BuildingSystems.HAM.Data.MaterialProperties.Thermal.Wood()});
        end Construction1THM;

   * Assignment of an construction type

     Now you can assign this common construction type to all the opaque construction elements by inserting
     component references using the component parameter dialog of Dymola:

     .. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM08.*
        :scale: 75 %

     The generated code, for example for *wall1* shall look now like:

     .. code-block:: modelica

        BuildingSystems.Buildings.Constructions.Walls.WallThermal1DNodes wall1(
          redeclare Construction1THM constructionData,
          width=0.5,
          height=0.5,
          angleDegAzi=90.0,
          angleDegTil=90.0);

  * Create in the same manner for the partition wall a second *construction2THM*,
    which only consists in one layer of wood with a thickness of 0.009 m and assign it afterwards to *wall7*.

Configure the system model and set its boundary conditions
----------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/TutorialMZM09.*
   :scale: 80 %

   System model of the THM

1. Create a new model with the name *SystemModel* and insert it into the package *ThermalModelHouse*.
#. Instantiate the previous defined building model within the system model and rename it to *building*.
#. Instantiate an ambient model *BuildingSystems.Buildings.Ambient* within the system model and set the climate data
   (parameter weatherDataFile) to *WeatherDataFile_USA_SanFrancisco*.
#. Assign the parameter *nSurfaces* of the ambient model to the number of surfaces of the building, which are in contact
   with the building environment:

   .. code-block:: modelica

      nSurfaces={building.nSurfacesAmbient)

#. Connect the ambient model and the building model regarding to their blue interfaces (boundary conditions of the facade surfaces to the air)
   and their green interfaces (boundary conditions of the facade surfaces to the solar irradiation and other enclosing surfaces)
#. Connect the output variable *ambient.TAirRef* and the input variable *building.TAirAmb* (ambient temperature at
   a reference height of 10 m) and also *ambient.xAirRef* and *building.xAirAmb* (ambient absolute moisture).
#. Add six constant sources of the type *Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant* for the definition of
   the set temperatures for heating and cooling as well as the air change for both thermal zones:

   .. code-block:: modelica

      ..
      Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant TSetHeatingZone1(k=273.15 + 22.0);
      Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant TSetCoolingZone2(k=273.15 + 20.0);
      Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant TSetHeatingZone1(k=273.15 + 26.0);
      Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant TSetCoolingZone2(k=273.15 + 24.0);
      Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant airchangeZone1(k=0.5);
      Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant airchangeZone2(k=0.5);

   and connect them to the input signals of the building model.

   Caused by this definition of the set temperatures *zone1* will have
   a higher temperature level than *zone2* during the simulation experiment.

The Modelica code of the described example of this chapter can be found under

https://github.com/UdK-VPT/BuildingSystems/blob/master/BuildingSystems/Resources/Documentation/ExamplesUserGuide/ThermalModelHouse.mo .

Simulate the system model
-------------------------

* Perform a simulation with the system model over 10 days (start time = 0.0 s end time = 60 s/h x 24 h/d * 10 d = 864000 s).

  The following diagrams illustrate selected results of the simulation experiment:

  1. The yearly air temperature for *zone1* and *zone2* and the outside air temperature  (1st to 3rd line).
  #. The corresponding ideal heating and cooling load for zone 1 (4th and 5th line).
  #. The corresponding ideal heating and cooling load for zone 2 (6th and 7th line).
  #. The heat flow by heat transmittance through both surfaces of *wall7* between both zones (8th and 9th line).
