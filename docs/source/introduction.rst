Introduction
============

This user guide shall explain the use of the Modelica library BuildingSystems (http://www.modelica-buildingsystems.de),
which is being developed for dynamic simulation of the energetic behavior of single rooms, buildings and whole districts.

One important part of the library consists of an adaptive building model, which is able to adapt its spatial resolution
(0D, 1D, 3D modelling approach) and also its physical model (e.g. pure thermal or a hygro-thermal calculation) to the
respective problem of the simulation analysis.

   Application of the simplified building model (0D modelling approach) for district modeling: 39 buildings
   of the Campus Berlin-Charlottenburg are connected by a district heating grid (ATES project).

**Level of detail (LOD) 0D**: The adaptive building model works in a strongly simplified and abstracted configuration
(low-order or grey box model), which leads to numerically fast calculations. A typical case study is the
simultaneous calculation of the thermal energy demand of a huge number of single buildings of a district
in combination with a district heating network (compare with figure 1.1).

**Level of detail (LOD) 1D**: In this case the adaptive building model uses more spatially resolved algorithms and models
and also more simulation time for a single building. A typical application are multi-zone-building models,
which calculate for each thermal zone the heating and cooling energy demand, the air temperatures and air moistures and also
the air exchange between the single thermal zones of a complex building. E.g. the Rooftop building of figure 1.2 has
four different air-conditioned rooms, so it could be modelled with four thermal zones.

   of the BuildingSystems library (left) and with ANSYS CFD (right) (project UCaHS)

**Level of detail (LOD) 3D**: The most advanced configuration consists of a spatially resolved room model,
which describes the three-dimensional air flow within a room volume, the geometrical long-wave and
short-wave radiation distribution and also the multidimensional heat transport within the building construction.
For example, this model is able to calculate the location-dependent thermal comfort within a room (compare with figure 1.3).

The BuildingSystems library supports for all three LODs pure thermal or hygro-thermal calculations (multi-physics modelling approach).
Also a mixed thermal and hygro-thermal simulation analysis and different spatial resolutions for different
parts of a building model are supported.
