Simple building model
=====================

In the first example a simplified building model is connected with an ambient model, which supplies the
building model with the climate data of a given location (Berlin, Germany). Several fundamental working steps
for the application of the BuildingSystems library (together with Dymola 2016 or higher) such as

* the configuration of a system model structure,
* the definition of the building model parameters,
* the definition of the boundary conditions of the building model and
* the performance of a simulation experiment

are explained. The used building model *BuildingSystems.Buildings.BuildingTemplates.Building1Zone1DBox*
uses a thermal 1D-modeling approach, that means all models of the building
constructions (walls, roof, ground plate etc.) are discretized regarding energy balancing in one dimension
and the air space within the zone is modeled with one aggregated thermal node.

Set up the system model structure
---------------------------------

Download the BuildingSystems library from https://github.com/UdK-VPT/BuildingSystems. Open the library with Dymola
and perform the following steps:

1. Open dialog: *File* -> *New* -> *Model* and fill in the field *Name:* "SimpleBuilding".

#. Extend the new model from *Modelica.Icons.Example* and click OK.

#. Mark the new example *SimpleBuilding* in the package browser and save it with *File* -> *Save*
   in the file *SimpleBuilding.mo* in a folder of your choice.

#. Drag and drop a component model from the Dymola package browser of the class
   *BuildingSystems.Buildings.BuildingTemplates.Building1Zone1DBox* and rename it to *building*.
   This component is able to calculate the thermal energy balance of a one-zone thermal building model.
   It fits to our first example because it needs only the definition of few parameters for a simulation analysis.

#. Instantiate in the same manner by drag and drop an ambient model *BuildingsSystems.Buildings.Ambient* and
   set the climate data (parameter weatherDataFile) to *WeatherDataFile_Germany_Berlin*. Now pre-calculated
   hourly weather data from Meteonorm (http://www.meteonorm.com/en/) for Berlin is used to support the building model
   with ambient values of air temperature, moisture, direct and diffuse radiation, wind speed and wind direction.

6. Connect the blue connectors *ambient.toAirPorts* and *building.toAmbientAirPorts*
   of both models. Now the climate boundary conditions which are caused by the ambient air of the building
   will be considered (convective heat transfer and optionally also the moisture transport).

7. Then connect the green connectors *ambient.toSurfacePorts* and *building.toAmbientSurfacePorts*
   of the ambient and the building model. This enables the ambient model to deliver the boundary conditions
   for short-wave radiation from the sun and the long-wave radiation exchange with the sky.

#. The ambient model has to know the number of surfaces of the building model, which are in contact with
   the ambient air. For this purpose double-click on the ambient component and add this information to
   the parameter *ambient.nSurfaces* by inserting a component reference: building ->
   extends BuildingSystems.Buildings.BaseClasses.BuildingTemplate -> nSurfacesAmbient.

#. Connect the output variable *ambient.TAirRef*  and the input variable *building.TAirAmb* (ambient temperature at
   a reference height of 10 m) and also *ambient.xAirRef* and *building.xAirAmb* (ambient absolute moisture). Both
   variables are necessary for the calculation of the energy loss caused by the air exchange of the building.

Define the building model parameters
------------------------------------

1. **Define the building dimensions**. The inner space of the building shall have a dimension of 9 m width,
   9 m length and 3 m height (these dimensions are equal to the enclosed air space,
   the outer dimension of the building model depend on the thickness of the selected wall, roof
   and base plate constructions). Fill in these values within the tab *General* (group Geometry)
   in the parameter dialog of the building component.

   Definition of the geometry of the building model

2. **Define the type of opaque construction** in the building model component. For this purpose select

   * for all exterior walls (constructionWall1 to constructionWall4) the type *Outer wall construction for single-family house EnEv 2014*,
   * for the roof (constructionCeiling) the type *Roof construction for single-family house EnEv 2014* and
   * for the base plate (constructionBottom) the type *BasePlate construction for single-family house EnEv 2014*

   in the group exterior constructions within the tab *Opaque constructions*. Set the parameters *InteriorWalls*
   and *InteriorCeilings* to false (group Interior constructions on the same tab), because interior constructions shall be neglected.

   Definition of the opaque constructions

3. **Define the type of transparent constructions** in the building model. Select for all windows (window1 to window4) the
   type *Heat protection double glazing with UValGla=1.4W/(m2.K) and g=0.58*. Define the size of *window1* to 3 m width by
   1 m height and for the *window2*, *window3* and *window4* to 1 m width by 1 m height.

   Definition of the transparent constructions

Set the boundary conditions of the building model
-------------------------------------------------

1. **Define the set temperatures for heating and cooling** and the **air change rate**. Therefor add three instances of the MSL model class
   *Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Constant* to the system model. Rename them to *TSetHeating*, *TSetCooling* and *airchange* and
   parametrize them with 273.15 + 20.0 (20 degree Celsius) 273.15 + 24.0 (24 degree Celsius) and 0.5 (half air change per hour).
   Connect the output of the three blocks with the corresponding input variables *building.TSetHeating*, *building.TSetCooling*
   and *building.airchange* of the building model.

The Modelica code of the described example of this chapter can be found under

https://github.com/UdK-VPT/BuildingSystems/blob/master/BuildingSystems/Resources/Documentation/ExamplesUserGuide/SimpleBuilding.mo .

Simulate the system model
-------------------------

Now the model is 100 percent prepared for a simulation analysis. Simulate the model over a time period of one year. For
this purpose select the experiment *SimpleBuilding* in the package browser of Dymola and switch to the simulation mode.

1. Open the *Simulation Setup* dialog and fill in 31536000 (3600 seconds/hour x 24 hours/day x 365 days/year = 31536000 seconds)
   into the *Stop time* entry field and perform the simulation experiment.

#. Study the simulation results: the next both diagrams show the main important temperatures
   (outside and inside air temperature, operative temperature) and the ideal heating and cooling power
   for the building, which guarantees the indoor air temperature in the wished area between 20 to 24 degree Celsius.

The first diagram illustrates that the indoor air temperature and the operative temperature (the mean value of the indoor air
temperature and the mean surface temperature within the zone) are close together. The reason is the insulated construction
of the walls, the ceiling and the base plate regarding the present German energy code (EnEV 2014). Only during some summer days
the indoor air temperature reaches maximum values of 24 degree Celsius.

At the location Berlin the thermal energy demand is close to 100 percent caused by heating energy. Only during some of the hot summer days
a small amount of cooling energy is needed.

Change the climate location
---------------------------

In the next step the location shall be changed to study the impact of a hot and dry climate on the thermal energy demand
of the building model in comparison to the moderate climate of Berlin. For this purpose change the parameter weatherDataFile
within the ambient component to *WeatherDataFile_Iran_Hashtgerd* (Hashtgerd is a city in north Iran 100 km west of Tehran).

In comparison to Berlin the outside temperature is close to 40 degree Celsius during the summer (Berlin 32 degree Celsius). This
leads to a significant cooling demand in summer, but there is still a relevant heating demand in winter.

Visualization of the model
--------------------------

An additional package of the BuildingSystems library, the BuildingSystems_Vis3D library enables a 3D
visualization of the building and energy plant models. The package can be downloaded from https://github.com/UdK-VPT/BuildingSystems_Vis3D.

   Visualisation of the building model in the explode model. To obtain this kind of exploded visualisation the parameter
   explode of the building model has to be set to true. A second parameter explodeDistance was set to 2.0,
   that means all building constructions are shifted 2 m away from their original positions.
